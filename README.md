Details about the project. This is about the Forest Cover type in the Roosevelt National Park. 

This project was done as part of the capstone project  where the study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:

1 - Spruce/Fir  
2 - Lodgepole Pine  
3 - Ponderosa Pine  
4 - Cottonwood/Willow  
5 - Aspen  
6 - Douglas-fir  
7 - Krummholz
